===========

Given a (guaranteed valid) UTF-8 encoded text file comprised of whitespace-delimited data, find the following things:

1) Any datum starting with a Greek character and ending with a Cyrillic one.     
2) Any datum that contains a balanced set of square brackets.     
3) Any datum that contains at least two double letters in a row.     
4) Any integer that is larger than the most recent integer seen (do not capture the first integer seen).     
5) Any datum that is a same character repeated a prime number of times.


Once all these data are extracted from the corpus, the program should print a list of frequencies of these terms, from most to least frequent.

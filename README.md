Given a (guaranteed valid) UTF-8 encoded text file comprised of whitespace-delimited data, find the following things:      Any datum starting with a Greek character and ending with a Cyrillic one.     Any datum that contains a balanced set of square brackets.     Any datum that contains at least two double letters in a row.     Any integer that is larger than the most recent integer seen (do not capture the first integer seen).     Any datum that is a same character repeated a prime number of times.
